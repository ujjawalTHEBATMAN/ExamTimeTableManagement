Ideal for keys, intent extras, notification IDs, etc.
3. Resource Files (res/ Directory)
Layout XML Files:

activity_main.xml
Purpose:
The main interface of the app, allowing navigation to teacher or student modules.
activity_exam_scheduler.xml & activity_auto_scheduler.xml

A form interface for entering subject and paper details.
activity_exam_list.xml
Purpose:
Lists exams in a recycler or list view.
Includes long press event listeners on each exam item.
activity_resource_view.xml & activity_revision_plan.xml
Purpose:
Provides detailed views for learning resources and revision planning.
Values Directory (strings, colors, styles):

strings.xml:
Purpose:
Contains all the text used in the UI, making it easier to maintain and support multiple languages.
colors.xml & styles.xml:
Purpose:
Define the color scheme and overall look & feel.
Include definitions for themes (e.g., dark/light modes).
Drawable Directory:

Implementation Highlights
Teacher vs. Student Modules:

Keep separate packages for teacher and student functionalities. This modularity simplifies maintenance and allows for role-based access control.
Long Press Event Handling:

In ExamListActivity.java, add a long press listener on each list item. On detecting a long press, call a method in LongPressHandler.java to dispatch the correct intent (e.g., open both ResourceViewActivity and RevisionPlanActivity or show a dialog offering the two options).
Auto Scheduler Integration:

AutoSchedulerActivity.java should rely on the helper methods in ScheduleGenerator.java to construct a valid exam timetable based on provided constraints.
Notification Management:

Use NotificationReceiver.java to schedule reminders for upcoming exams. This receiver will be registered in your manifest and triggered via AlarmManager or similar scheduling services.
This structure should give you a robust starting point for your Exam Timetable Management app. Each file and package is purpose-built to separate concerns between teacher and student roles, manage exam scheduling (both manual and automatic), and handle user interactions like long press events that trigger additional educational resources. Feel free to adjust and expand based on additional requirements or design iterations.
